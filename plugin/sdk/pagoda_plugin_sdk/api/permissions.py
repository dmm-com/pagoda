    This class provides a standardized framework for implementing
    permissions in plugins while maintaining compatibility with

    The permission system works at two levels:
    1. View-level permissions (has_permission) - Check if user can access the view
    2. Object-level permissions (has_object_permission) - Check if user can access specific objects
