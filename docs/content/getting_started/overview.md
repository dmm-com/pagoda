### Data model that meets with extensibility

Pagoda manages informaiton by using following two type of data-structure.

* Entity - has meta data (what kind of data it has and how).
* Entry - has actual data in conformity to an Entity which is associated with it.

This page shows an example how to manage information which has complex data-structure in this system as an example of an information management system of a library. This system manages book location information (where book is arranged in), book management information (what kind book is registered) and lending information (which book is lent to whom).
